# data_literacy_ws_21_22
Data Literacy project and report for winter semester at the university of Tuebingen. This course is given by Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig. The report is supervised by Lukas Tatzel. 

In this project, we analyze the VAERS data set. We attempt to use the available data to answer the following question: How likely is it to be hospitalized after complete vaccination? Based on the number of adverse events that can occur after full vaccination and based on patient information such as age, gender, and pre-existing conditions, we attempt to predict if a patient will be hospitalized or
not. For model training, we use logistic regression and decision trees.
