What can be done with VAERS?

VAERS can also be used to see which preexisting health 
conditions may be associated with certain types of reactions, 
and this can lead to contraindications, as in the case of 
allergic reactions. The reporting system can also notice 
vaccine lots associated with an unusually high number of 
reported events (which might mean a rare case of a vaccine 
lot being contaminated) and it can identify specific 
locations in the United States where events are clustering.

And it provides that country with transparent, country-wide 
statistics on vaccine-related adverse events.
